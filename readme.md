# ðŸ“¦  Kevin Wolf's Docker Images

This monorepo contains images that could be used either for local development (via [Visual Studio Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)) or production (they are small).

They look pretty much like the [alpine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine), the main difference is that it is setup using my opinionated [dotfiles](https://github.com/elkevinwolf/dotfiles).

## Included images

- [`elkevinwolf/base`](./base)
- [`elkevinwolf/node`](./node)
